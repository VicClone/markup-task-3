                        Bellatrix Lestrange (née Black) (1951 – 2 May, 1998)
                        was a pure-blood witch,
                        the eldest daughter of Cygnus Black III
                        and Druella Black (née Rosier) and elder sister
                        ofAndromeda Tonks and Narcissa Malfoy.
                        She was a member of the House of Black, an old wizarding family
                        and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.
                        Bellatrix started her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
                        Wizardry in 1962 and was Sorted into Slytherin House.
                        After graduating from Hogwarts she became a Death Eater.
                        She was fanatically loyal to Lord Voldemort and was among
                        the most dangerous and sadistic of his followers.
                        While Bellatrix and Narcissa married pure-blood wizards
                        Andromeda married Muggle-born Ted Tonks and was disowned by the family.
                        Andromeda was burned off the Black family tree and
                        they were forbidden to talk about her.
                        At the end of the First Wizarding War,
                        while searching for information on Lord Voldemort:
                        Bellatrix, Rodolphus Lestrange (husband),
                        Rabastan Lestrange (brother-in-law), and Barty Crouch Jr
                        took part in the torture of the Aurors
                        Frank and Alice Longbottom driving them insane.
                        They were caught and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.

                        Lord Voldemort placed the Dark Mark brand on his followers'
                        inner left forearms both as a sign of their loyalty
                        to him and as a method of summoning themto him when he desired.
                        This was done by pressing his finger to any Death Eater's Mark,
                        which turns it jet black and delivers a burning sensation
                        to any person with the Dark Mark. Feeling the burn,
                        the Death Eaters then Apparate to Voldemort's side.
                        It is unknown whether all Death Eaters will always feel the burning,
                        or if Voldemort can choose to signal a specific person or people.
                        The deepness of the Mark's colour is connected to Voldemort's physical health.
                        When Voldemort suffered his first defeat,
                        the Marks on the Death Eaters faded, but as he began regaining his strength,
                        the faded marks became clearer, and burnt slightly,
                        a sign of Voldemort's return to his Death Eaters.

                        <p class="article">
                            The Dark Mark appears as a glittering green skull
                            with a snake protruding from its mouth.
                            This might have been inspired by the hiding place
                            of the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets.
                            When summoned, the basilisk would emerge from the mouth of Salazar Slytherin.
                            The serpent is also the symbol of Slytherin house,
                            and thus appropriate to be used by the Heir of Slytherin.
                            The symbol might also be related to Lord Voldemort being a Parselmouth,
                            a gift he thoughtmade him unlike the rest of the wizarding world.
                            The Dark Mark on the forearm is black,
                            while the Dark Mark conjured by Morsmordre is green,
                            this is most likely for more contrast with each respective background
                            as a black Dark Mark would be hard to see in the night sky.
                            It is also said that the Dark Mark represents immortality and power.
                            The Dark Mark is the symbol of Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.
                            It refers both to a magically induced brand that every
                            Death Eater bears on his or her inner left forearm,
                            and to the same symbol conjured in the air by the spell Morsmordre.
                            An inactive Dark Mark appears as a faint
                            mark on the inner part of the left forearm,
                            similar to that of "a vivid red tattoo"; an active one is jet black.
